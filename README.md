# E-Commerce on Clothing

As a requirement in my undergraduate program, I designed the frontend and backend of a website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Backend querying language was SQL. 

To Run the project, Host a local server or get a web hosting
Easiest Way to it is using XAMPP with phpMyAdmin Database

Step 1: Install and run XAMPP, 
- start services
- Start Apache, MySQL, ProFTPD

Step 2: For a mac, under volume -> mount -> explore
- under htdocs folder move the project folder
- open the browser and type in (IP Address given by xampp)/phpmyadmin
- from project->database, import Zanders.sql into phpmyadmin
- open browser and type in (IP Address given by xampp)/E-Commerce-on-Clothing-master/index.html

for windows, 
- C:/(Locate XAMPP/htdocs)
- move project folder into it
- open the browser and type in localhost/phpmyadmin
- from project->database, import Zanders.sql into phpmyadmin
- open browser and type in localhost/E-Commerce-on-Clothing-master/index.html
